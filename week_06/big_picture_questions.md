What is the issue with the question: *"What is the effect of being African?"* 

There is **so** much that could possibly be meant by the questin. For example 

- What is the effect of colonial legacy? 
- What is the effect of global marginalization? 
- What is the effect of religion? 
- What is the effect of phenotypic representation? 
- What is the effect of ... ?

The question is at once posed so broadly that it there is not a specific question that one can answer while at the same time having narrow interpretations that are fundimentally unanswerable. 

Second, we would like to ask people (optionally) read a piece by [Maya Sen and Omar Wasow](https://github.prod.oc.2u.com/UCB-MIDS/w241/blob/master/readings/sen.2016.pdf) that asks fundamental questions about whether race is an essential characteristic, inherited at egg fertilization, or is instead an identity that is constructed, presented, and read by others. 

There are several reasons that we like this piece: (1) 

1. It is more careful in its language than we are in the async lecture; but, the authors intentionally avoid as much of the high-academic language that can sometimes be present in writing about these questions. 
2. It asks a very hard question from the point of view of our class: it is possible to conduct an experiment that answers this question?

# Guidelines for Submitting Documents
## General Guidelines 
- Please submit a markdown document that contains all your code and answers. 
- This document should be created by a `.Rmd` file that we can execute that produces all answers, without error. 
- Your work should be created on a new branch called `answers` 
- You do not need to show work for trivial calculations, but showing work is always allowed.
- For answers that involve a narrative response, please feel free to describe the key concept directly and briefly, if you can do so, and do not feel pressure to go on at length.
- Please ask us questions about the problem set if you get stuck. *Donâ€™t spend more than 20 minutes puzzling over what a problem means.* 
- Please ensure that someone (us!) can compile your solution set. The best way is to use the web-hosted links we've provided. 
- For text answers, please **embolden** your answers to the questions.
- For computing answers, please store them in the answer objects we have created. 
- Use inline code evaluation to write your answers. 

## Github Classroom Guidelines 
- Commit frequently. 
- Issue a PR when you're done with your problem set. We will review the PR and make inline comments. 
- This is the [general workflow](https://github.com/jfiksel/github-classroom-for-students) that we expect you'll be using for the assignments. 
- If you're using Rstudio, you can consider using the built in Git tooltip. Otherwise, feel free to simply use the command line.

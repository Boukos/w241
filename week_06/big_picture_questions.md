(1) Highlight that the issue with the question, "What is the effect of being African?" is that there is so much that could possibly be meant my that, for example (a) What is the effect of colonial legacy? (b) What is the effect of global marginalization? (c) What is the effect of religion? (d) What is the effect of skin color? 

Second, I'd like to ask people (optionally) read a piece by Maya Sen and Omar Wasow that asks fundamental questions about whether race is an essential characteristic, inherited at egg fertilization, or is instead an identity that is constructed, presented, and read by others. There are several reasons that I like this piece: (1) It is more careful in its language than David is in the async lecture; but, the authors intentionally avoid as much of the high-academic language that can sometimes creep into writing of this kind; (2) It asks a very hard question from the point of view of our class: it is possible to conduct an experiment that answers this question?
